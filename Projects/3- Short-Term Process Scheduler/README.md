# CST-315 Project 3: Short-Term Process Scheduler

Attached there are 4 files.
* scheduler.cpp
* shellfish.cpp
* README.txt
* Short-Term Process Scheduler Report.docx

scheduler.cpp and shellfish.cpp are C++ code that is written in Visual Studio Code. 

To run, first go to the directory file path and type "g++ shellfish.cpp -o Shellfish". Then once that has executed, type "./Shellfish". This will run the shell code. 

Next, while the shell prompt is open, type "g++ scheduler.cpp -o Scheduler -lpthread". Then once that has executed, type "./Scheduler". This will run the scheduler code inside of our shell that we created.

Short-Term Process Scheduler Report.docx contains the report with all of our screenshots and analysis.
